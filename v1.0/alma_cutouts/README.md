Here we present a series of cutouts for all securely (SN>4) objects detected with ALMA in ALCS. 

A detailed description of these figures will be soon available in Fujimoto et al. 2022 (in prep.).

Each panel includes a 10" cutouts showing, from left to right, a natural ALMA map, a tapered ALMA map, HST/ACS, HST/WFC3 and IRAC Channel 1.
The overlaid contours trace 1, 2 and 3 sigma confidence.
