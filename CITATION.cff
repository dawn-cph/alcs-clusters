abstract: "We present a set of multi-wavelength mosaics and photometric catalogs in the ALMA
            lensing cluster survey (ALCS) fields. The catalogs were built by reprocessing of 
            archival data from the CHArGE compilation, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
            in the RELICS, CLASH and Hubble Frontier Fields. Additionally we have reconstructed 
            the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 Î¼m mosaics, by utilising all the available archival IRSA/SHA exposures.
            To alleviate the effect of blending in such a crowded region, we have modelled the Spitzer photometry 
            by convolving the HST detection image with the Spitzer PSF using the novel golfir software. 
            The final catalogs contain 218,000 sources, covering a combined area of 690 arcmin2."
